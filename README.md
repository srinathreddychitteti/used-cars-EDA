# Used Cars Exploratory Data Analysis

In this project I performed Exploratory data analysis on the used cars dataset from  Kaggle

I have shown some barcharts and som basic conclusions that can be drawn from the data like:

1) What is the city with highest number of listings
2) What is the state with highest number of listings
3) Which automobile company cars are most listed
4) Which make of the cars are most listed
